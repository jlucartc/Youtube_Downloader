## How to use
- Download the project folder and then import it through your browser's extension page.
- Close and reopen your browser, or refresh your tabs.
- Visit some youtube video link.
- Click on the extension's browser icon.
- Search for the desired media and click in Download.
- Wait until the download is completed and then click again to save the file in your machine.

## Some tips
- You shouldn't keep downloaded data in your browser, since it may occupy more memory than it should.
- In case your file doesn't open in your video player, remove it from the list and try downloading it again.
- Some data formats are not included in the filtering list, so they'll usually appear as 'video/mp4' or 'audio/webm'.
